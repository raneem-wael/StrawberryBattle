To move to carrot make sure your scentence has the word "carrot", the same with banana make sure your scentence has the word "banana".
To Attack here are the ley words -> "Attack","Shoot" and "FireBall"

If the model "speech to text" doesn't work here are some hints so you can test the project:
  LeftArrow -> moves to the carrot.
  RightArrow -> moves to the banana.
  UpArrow-> activate the shield.
  DownArrow-> activates the fireball.

  Note that the shield will be activated for oly three seconds, then you can call it again to activate it again.
  However, the fireball is shooting non stop unless you change to you skill to use the shield.
